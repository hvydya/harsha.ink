It's been almost six years since I started my journey in Japanese. Of those six, only three and half years I was actively learning.
The rest of the years, I didn't touch anything other than the occasional encounters on the Internet. So let's get to the main point :)

## Why Japanese?
When I was in school, I always was curious whenever I heard any foreign language. I used to wonder what's it like to read and understand one. After my 12th, I had some free time before I was about to join my college for Engineering in 2016. My friend and I decided to check out EFLU which was near to my house then. After enquiring we found that they were indeed offering part time, 1 year long courses in foreign languages so, I decided to take one. While filling the form I saw the courses that were listed. Arabic and French were the first two in the list but those classes were available only in the mornings so, I couldn't opt those. Next one in that list was Japanese and it had a convenient time slot for me so, I decided to go with it. 


So, like that I took my first class in Japanese, way back in 2016. I liked it so much that I was putting almost all my free time into it. The year passed and the course was over but I was still hungry to learn more, so I decided to extend my course for one more year(diploma). That year passed too and the course was over before I knew. There was a hiccup at the end of the course though. The final test for the Japanese course and my Engineering 2nd year finals were coinciding. There was no way I could attend both or postpone either. That meant I had to choose one. I chose Engineering because that's what gets you a good job(which is not entirely true) and also that is what was expected of me.

So, I didn't write the Japanese final which meant I failed the course. Because I failed the course, I couldn't continue it anymore for an other year (advanced diploma) in EFLU. But that didn't stop me from putting efforts into quenching my thirst. I decided to pursue it on my own. After the third year of Engineering began, I picked up where I left off the previous year in EFLU. I had the resources and a solid foundation which made it possible for me to learn on my own. After a few months, I was at the crossroads again where I had to choose learning it or focus on getting a job. I couldn't do both. Due to some reasons (which I will explain in an other post), I was really disappointed in the Engineering course. Conversely, Japanese was so much better in terms of the teachers and students at EFLU, my interests and motivations. I was so much into learning Japanese, specifically in EFLU, that I almost decided to drop off from the Engineering course and take up M.A Japanese at EFLU because I missed it that much. But my sister convinced me (it was very hard for her it seems) to not do that and finish my Engineering then pursue whatever I wanted to. So I decided to settle (finish the course and get a job) Engineering which took 2 years (end of 2020) to do. After finally getting a good job, I felt I was stable enough to afford some more free time than usual. I decided to restart Japanese in that free time. I decided to attempt N4 by the end of 2021 as a way to restart and test my retention. I passed it with a very good margin (87% :)). I was so happy and fired up when I saw that certificate, a feeling which didn't feel in many years.

Fast forward to now, I am attempting N3 in July and having a blast learning. Everyday I learn something new which pixel by pixel fills the picture that is Japanese.

"So, why Japanese?" you ask... <br>
"No specific reason!!!"

I am learning for the sake of learning. It's funny when I tell people: "That day when I was filling the form in EFLU, the order of languages in the list in that form led to me learning Japanese.", they always laugh.

Emotionally, learning Japanese was like being in a relationship for me: the getting-to-know, the falling-in-love, the parting, the reunion, the i-wont-leave-you-ever-again (which I'm in right now). And, that analogy strictly ends there :). 

Coming to my interest to learn and understand foreign languages: I plan to pick up other languages once I am done with N1. Until then, neither am I planning to stop learning Japanese nor am I planning to pick up a new language.

最後まで行くよ！！
